Calcifer's Langauge Pattern === THEORY ==
===========================================

=== =====
EMOJIS ==
=========
Taking in emojis would allow Cal. to know whether or not the responses are more positive or less so.
Continuation of talking is positive! === so +1


========================
LANGUAGE PATTERN FLOW  =
========================
If calcifer could recognize where! he was in the conversation he would know what were the likely next moves to make!
============================
=== BEGINNING ==== OPENER = get them talking
=== MIDDLE ======= ESCALATION = get them in an emotionally accepting state
=== END ========== CLOSE = conclude the conversation with completing the goal.
====================================================================================================
Calcifer can use these to determine which parts of the data base to query!... ===> If this is true: He'll need to know how to measure where he is at in the conversation pattern to be able to make moves...
He would need to be able to move forward in this pattern === and backwards and gage probabilities on how close he was to needing to make a move onto the next section...

BEGINNING
===========================
- Data Query of good starts
- Ability to determine bad starts
- Ability to self test these rapidly!!!
- Ability to tell when the closing is done!
    -- Response time...
