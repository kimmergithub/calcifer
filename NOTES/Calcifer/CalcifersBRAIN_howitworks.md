Calcifer's Brain_How_it_works === THEORY ==
===========================================
  Calcifer uses the scientific method to determine whether or not responses are appropriate.

  The SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method
________________________________________________________
  1. OBSERVATION & OPINIONS

  CURRENT OBSERVATIONS:
    1. People use keywords to speak ENGLISH
    2. THERE ARE UNIVERSAL RULES TO SOCIAL DYNAMICS
    3. Computers can follow rules better than humans
    4. Humans can socialize better than computers...

  Formulate an Opinion

          - TYPES OF OPINIONS -
          =========================
          1. OPERATIONAL OPINIONS
            1. I / "We" can teach CALCIFER ENGLISH

          1. BASIC LEVEL OPINIONS
            1. Is Calcifer's response appropriate.
            2. Is Calcifer's inappropriate?

          2. MISSION LEVEL OPINIONS
            1. Does Calcifer's response get me towards my goal.

  2. HYPOTHESIS

    CURRENT HYPOTHESIS:
      1. Calcifer can learn how to speak ENGLISH if:
            1. He can learn general grammatical rules.
            2. He can pick up key words and formulate assumptions about what was said to him
            3. He can use these key words to formulate a response
            4. He is given feedback on whether or not the response is APPROPRIATE
            5. When responses are APPROPRIATE or INNAPPROPRIATE he can determine a value for HOW much there are appropriate or INNAPPROPRIATE.
                MOST IMPORTANT === PROBABILITIES
                1. He can use this data to formulate statics on how likely it is that USER meant what Calcifer thinks they meant, and how likely each possible response is to be an appropriate response.
            7. Calcifer can form a record of the current conversation and tie key words and concepts togethers...
                1. Cal can form probabilities that the response he is giving makes sense in the context of the conversation.
                2. Cal knows the difference between a response to a single entry, versus the response to something in the context of a conversation.

      2. Calcifer can ACHIEVE SOCIAL OBJECTS and SUCCEED IN NEGOTIATION TACTICS... ETC... IF:
            1. Calcifer can learn English!
            2. Calcifer can determine if his responses are leading him towards, or further from a goal.
              1. Calcifer can log this data and form probabilities around it.

  3. PREDICTION
      1. If the HYPOTHESIS is true:
          1. And I create a system that allows Calcifer to return responses based on picking up key phrases... or learning key phrases.
          2. And there is given feedback to those responses.
          3. If the rest of my hypothesis applies:
          4. Calcifer should learn ENGLISH

  4. TESTING
      1. Do it.

  5. Analyze
      1. Is calcifer getting better:
        YES or NO
        My opinion, their opinion!


===================================================
Calcifer's Brain ==== FEEDBACK STRUCTURE ==========
===================================================
1. RECEIVE entry
2. ANALYZE entry for key words
    1. Search Key words
3. FIND RESPONSE list
    1. ANALYZE list for probably appropriate RESPONSE
4. GIVE RESPONSE
5. RECEIVE feedback
    1. Assign values appropriate to feedback
6. IF Needed:  ASK FOR ALTERNATIVE RESPONSE
7. LOG DATABASE
8. REPEAT
